Q1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it and also write steps to do it.
Ans.  Cherry picking in Git is the process of selecting and applying a specific commit from one branch to another without merging the entire branch. It is useful when you want to pick individual changes form a commit and apply them elsewhere without merging all changes from a branch.

Use Cases:
	
1) Big Fix
2) Feature Porting
3) Selective Changes
4) Undo Mistakes

Steps : 
1) Find the Commit Hash
-> git log â€“oneline

2) Switch to the target-branch
-> git checkout main

3) Apply the commit
-> git cherry-pick e4f5g6h
